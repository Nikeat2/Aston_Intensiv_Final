The research, published in the journal Science, suggests that the rapid warming of the Arctic is disrupting the polar vortex, leading to extreme winter weather in regions like the Midwest and Northeast. This phenomenon, known asar vortex, leading to extreme winter weather in regions like the Midwest and Northeast. This phenomenon, known as 'Aar vortex, leading to extreme winter weather in regions like the Midwest and Northeast.
